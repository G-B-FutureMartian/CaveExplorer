# MUD
MUD is a type of game were the entire game is 
text, and you type in commands. MUD stands for
Multi User Dungeon. This type of game usually 
does not use ASCII art. To make changes to the
you have to edit the source code and restart
the server.

# MUSH
MUSH is a game style that branched off of MUD.
It stands for Multi User Shard Hallucination(
someone in the 80's came up with the name, not
me). The biggest difference between a MUD and a
MUSH is that in a MUSH you can type commands
in-game to edit the layout(like @dig to make a 
new room. More about MUDs and MUSHes ->

# Dependencies
This project aims to have as few as possible dependencies, but
there will be some dependencies. Currently,
the only dependency will be Flask, a library for creating servers. 
These servers will be local only,
and everything you do should be away from prying eyes.
